This repository showcases my machine learning course project, which earned first place in the competition! It tackles two real-world classification tasks using Twitter data: (1) identifying bot versus non-bot accounts and (2) distinguishing political from non-political tweets. By analyzing user behavior and tweet content, this project explores how NLP techniques can be used to address social media challenges.

In the first task, we examine Twitter user data, focusing on account activity patterns and metadata to determine whether an account is bot-operated. The second task involves analyzing tweet content to figure out if it has a political tone. To do this, we use natural language processing tools like tokenization, vectorization, and semantic analysis, turning the raw tweet text into meaningful features for classification.

The project is built using Python and key libraries like pandas, numpy, and sklearn. The repository contains three rounds of code, each showing iterative improvements in model performance, along with results and insights from each phase. With clear documentation and a practical approach to Twitter data, this project demonstrates how machine learning can effectively tackle social media data challenges.
